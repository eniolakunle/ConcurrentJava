# ðŸ§µ Concurrent Java

This project contains implementations for the concurrency exercises from *Learn Java With Projects* by Dr. Sean Kennedy & Maaike Van Putten. These exercises are designed to strengthen our understanding of Javaâ€™s concurrency and multithreading features, helping us build efficient, high-performance applications.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Covered

- **Thread Creation**: Creating and managing threads using Java's `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.
- **Synchronization**: Using synchronized blocks and methods to avoid race conditions.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensuring safe access to shared resources with thread-safe collections and atomic operations.
- **Executor Services**: Leveraging the `ExecutorService` to manage thread pools and handle concurrent tasks.
- **Future and Callable**: Implementing `Future` and `Callable` to handle asynchronous tasks with results.
